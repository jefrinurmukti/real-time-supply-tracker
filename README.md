## ‚ú® Key Features & Services

This project is composed of several microservices, each with distinct responsibilities:

* **üõçÔ∏è Product Service:**
    * Built on **MongoDB**.
    * Provides an endpoint to display goods. This service will be the foundation for the frontend interface.
* **üì¶ Order Service:**
    * Built on **MySQL DB**.
    * Manages customer orders.
    * Makes synchronous calls to the Inventory Service to confirm product availability.
    * Sends asynchronous notifications to customers (via Notification Service) about their order status.
* **üìã Inventory Service:**
    * Built on **MySQL DB**.
    * Tracks the quantity of goods in stock.
* **üîî Notification Service:**
    * A serverless API designed to notify customers about their order updates.
* **üõ°Ô∏è API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway):**
    * Acts as the single entry point for all client requests.
    * Routes requests to the appropriate microservices.
    * Filters incoming requests for security and other concerns.
* **üîë Auth Server:**
    * Manages authentication and authorization for the microservices ecosystem.
* **üåê Service Discovery (Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka):**
    * Allows services to register and discover each other dynamically.
    * Implements client-side caching for resilience when the Eureka server is down, similar to a Static Site Generation (SSG) approach for service availability.
* **‚öôÔ∏è Config Server (Spring Cloud Config):**
    * Centralizes configuration management for all microservices.
    * Integrated with **GitHub** and **HashiCorp Vault** for secure and version-controlled configurations.
* ** Kafka (Event-Driven Architecture):**
    * Facilitates event-driven activities, such as notifying customers when an order is placed.
    * The Kafka broker is set up using **Docker** and **Spring for Apache Kafka**.
* ** Resilience4j (Circuit Breaker):**
    * Implements fault tolerance using the Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker framework.
    * Safeguards the system by degrading functionality gracefully when a service call fails (e.g., during synchronous calls to the Inventory Service), routing clients to alternative flows or pages.
* ** Sleuth & Zipkin (Distributed Tracing):**
    * Provides distributed tracing capabilities with **Spring Cloud Sleuth** and a UI with **Zipkin**.
    * Helps track request flows across multiple services by adding trace and span IDs to API calls, enabling performance monitoring and issue diagnosis.
* ** Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana (ELK Stack):**
    * Provides a centralized logging and monitoring solution.
    * **Elasticsearch** for storing and searching logs.
    * **Logstash** for processing and shipping logs.
    * **Kibana** for visualizing logs and creating dashboards.

Each microservice typically follows a layered architecture for separation of concerns:

```

[HTTP Request] --\> [Controller]
|
v
[Service] -- (Optional: Message Queue e.g., Kafka) --\> [External Systems/Other Services]
|
v
[Repository] --\> [Database]

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later (Verify specific version compatibility)
* Docker & Docker Compose
* Maven or Gradle
* An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/spring-boot-microservices.git](https://github.com/your-username/spring-boot-microservices.git) # Replace 'your-username'
    cd spring-boot-microservices
    ```

2.  **Set up Kafka, Zipkin, Databases, and other backing services:**
    * This project likely uses a `docker-compose.yml` file to manage these services.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    *(Make sure to check the `docker-compose.yml` for service names and configurations.)*

3.  **Configure application properties:**
    * Each microservice will have its own `application.properties` or `application.yml` file (e.g., in `src/main/resources`).
    * Ensure database connections, Kafka broker addresses, Eureka server URLs, etc., are correctly configured. You might need to create profiles (e.g., `dev`, `prod`).

4.  **Build and run the services:**
    * Navigate to each microservice directory (e.g., `api-gateway`, `product-service`, etc.).
    * **Using Maven:**
        ```bash
        mvn clean install
        mvn spring-boot:run
        ```
    * **Using Gradle:**
        ```bash
        ./gradlew clean build
        ./gradlew bootRun
        ```
    * **Order of startup is important:**
        1.  Config Server (if not using local profiles for everything)
        2.  Eureka Discovery Server
        3.  Zipkin, Kafka, Databases (if not started by Docker Compose or if they need app-level interaction at startup)
        4.  Other microservices (Product, Order, Inventory, Notification)
        5.  API Gateway

---

## üîß Usage

Once all services are running:

* **API Gateway:** Typically available at `http://localhost:PORT_OF_API_GATEWAY` (e.g., `http://localhost:8080` or `http://localhost:8765`). This is your main entry point.
* **Eureka Server:** View registered services at `http://localhost:PORT_OF_EUREKA` (e.g., `http://localhost:8761`).
* **Zipkin UI:** Track requests at `http://localhost:PORT_OF_ZIPKIN` (e.g., `http://localhost:9411`).
* **Kibana UI:** View logs and dashboards at `http://localhost:PORT_OF_KIBANA` (e.g., `http://localhost:5601`).

### Example Endpoints

*(These are illustrative. Replace with your actual endpoints.)*

* **Product Service:**
    * `GET /api/products` - List all products
    * `GET /api/products/{id}` - Get product by ID
* **Order Service:**
    * `POST /api/orders` - Create a new order
    * `GET /api/orders/{id}` - Get order details
* **Inventory Service:**
    * `GET /api/inventory/{productId}` - Check stock for a product
